## Task Description
Remove the useState usage and refactor it to handle all of the components state through a useReducer hook

The state should include:

* the current count value
* the “Number to Increment/Decrement by”

The useReducer hook should be used to update the state whenever the buttons are clicked along with the updating of the “Number to Increment/Decrement by” value.

This assignment is a straightforward way to demonstrate that you understand the useReducer hook and give you a chance to practice using it to manage state in a React application.

## Notes
When the page is loaded the movies are not sorted and when the button is clicked, the sort (asc/desc) that is shown on the button is the current sort being displayed on the screen
