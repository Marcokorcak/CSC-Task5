## Task Description
Remove the useState usage and refactor it to handle all of the components state through a useReducer hook

The state should include:

* the current count value
* the “Number to Increment/Decrement by”

The useReducer hook should be used to update the state whenever the buttons are clicked along with the updating of the “Number to Increment/Decrement by” value.
